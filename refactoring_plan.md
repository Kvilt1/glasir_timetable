## Refactoring Plan for Glasir Timetable Project

### Goal
To analyze the 'glasir_timetable' project, identify areas for improvement, and create a detailed plan for refactoring, optimization, and cleanup.

### Project Overview
The project extracts timetable data from Glasir's website. It uses JavaScript-based navigation (although this is supposedly being phased out), handles authentication, extracts homework, and manages cookies.

### Key Areas for Improvement:
*   **Error Handling:** The code includes error handling, but it could be more consistent and informative.
*   **Code Duplication:** There might be duplicated code, especially in the extraction and parsing logic.
*   **Performance:** The project uses asynchronous operations, but there might be opportunities for further optimization.
*   **Modularity:** The project could be more modular, with clear separation of concerns.
*   **API Usage:** The project is transitioning to API-based data extraction, so I should focus on that area.
*   **Documentation:** The code includes docstrings, but they could be more detailed and comprehensive.
*   **Testing:** The project includes a test file, but more tests might be needed to ensure the code's correctness.

### Plan:

1.  **Analyze Core Modules:**
    *   `api_client.py`: Analyze API calls, error handling, and data parsing.
    *   `navigation.py`: Analyze navigation logic and API usage.
    *   `services.py`: Analyze service interfaces and implementations.
    *   `models.py`: Analyze data models and validation.
    *   `extractors/timetable.py`: Analyze timetable extraction and parsing logic.
2.  **Identify Improvements:**
    *   Look for code duplication, potential performance bottlenecks, and areas for better error handling.
    *   Identify opportunities to improve modularity and separation of concerns.
    *   Assess the completeness and clarity of docstrings.
    *   Check for potential security vulnerabilities.
3.  **Suggest Improvements:**
    *   Provide specific suggestions for code refactoring, optimization, and cleanup.
    *   Suggest improvements to error handling, documentation, and testing.
    *   Propose changes to improve modularity and separation of concerns.
4.  **Create a Detailed Plan:**
    *   Create a detailed plan with specific steps for implementing the suggested improvements.
    *   Include Mermaid diagrams to visualize the plan.
5.  **Get User Approval:**
    *   Ask the user if they are pleased with the plan or if they would like to make any changes.
6.  **Write Plan to Markdown File:**
    *   Ask the user if they'd like me to write the plan to a markdown file.
7.  **Switch to Code Mode:**
    *   Use the switch\_mode tool to request that the user switch to another mode to implement the solution.
